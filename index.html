					<h1>From Roots to Refreshment, Our Beverage Journey</h1>
					<p>What began as a humble dream in our parents' small kitchen has grown into a vibrant legacy built on taste, tradition, &amp; innovation.</p>
					<p>Years ago, our parents, driven by a passion for authentic flavors &amp; natural ingredients, started a small-scale beverage business. With simple tools, time-honored recipes, &amp; a deep love for Indian taste traditions, they handcrafted syrups &amp; concentrates that quickly became local favorites.</p>
					<p>Their signature blends, especially the zesty Nimbu Ginger, tangy Lemon Masala, &amp; tropical Pink Peru, captured the hearts of families looking for refreshing &amp; nostalgic flavors.</p>
					<p>Now, as the next generation—a brother-sister duo with unwavering dedication, they were joined by a few close, precious friends as extended family—who believed in the vision. Together, they poured passion, trust, &amp; innovation into every bottle, giving birth to a renewed brand with a modern heartbeat &amp; traditional soul.—we are proud to carry the torch forward. Inspired by our parents’ dedication &amp; guided by modern innovation, we are taking the brand to new heights.</p>
					<p>We've introduced a line of Ready-to-Serve (RTS) beverages crafted from the same treasured recipes, perfect for today’s fast-paced lifestyle without compromising on purity or taste. Alongside, our range of concentrates continues to empower homes, cafes, &amp; businesses to serve quality drinks with ease &amp; authenticity.</p>
					<p>Together, we're not just building a business.</p>
					<p>We're bottling memories.</p>
					<p>We're refreshing legacies.</p>
					<p>We're raising a toast to family, flavor, &amp; the future</p>
